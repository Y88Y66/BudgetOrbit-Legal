# Privacy Policy for BudgetOrbit

**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025

Welcome to BudgetOrbit. Your privacy is a top priority for us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application. Our core privacy principle is simple: your financial data is yours. We designed BudgetOrbit to be a private, secure space for you to manage your finances.

### 1. Data Storage: Your Data Stays on Your Device

BudgetOrbit operates primarily on a local-first model. All of your financial data, including:
- Transaction records (income and expenses)
- Custom categories
- Savings goals
- Card and account details

is stored **locally and exclusively on your device(s)** using Apple's secure SwiftData framework. We, the developers of BudgetOrbit, do not have access to, collect, or store this personal financial data on any server.

### 2. Information We Collect

To provide our service, we handle a minimal amount of data:

#### a) Information from "Sign in with Apple"

We use Apple's official "Sign in with Apple" service for user authentication. When you sign in, we receive a unique, anonymous User ID provided by Apple. We may also request your name and email address to personalize your experience, subject to your consent during the sign-in process.

- **Apple User ID:** This is stored securely in your device's Keychain to keep you logged in.
- **Name and Email:** If you choose to share them, this information is used solely within the app and is not shared with any third parties.

#### b) Non-Personal Information for App Functionality

To provide real-time currency exchange rates, our app communicates with the publicly available API at `api.frankfurter.dev`. This process is anonymous and does not involve sending any of your personal or financial data to the service.

#### c) Analytics

BudgetOrbit **does not** use any third-party analytics or tracking tools. We do not collect data about your usage patterns or behavior within the app.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

The limited information we handle is used exclusively to:
- Provide, operate, and maintain the core functionality of BudgetOrbit.
- Securely authenticate your account via "Sign in with Apple".
- Enable user-initiated features, such as data backup and restore.

### 4. Data Backup and Restore

BudgetOrbit provides a feature that allows you to manually export a backup of your data. This backup is created as a JSON file that you can save to your local device storage or your personal iCloud Drive. This process is entirely **user-initiated and controlled**. We do not automatically sync or back up your data to any cloud service. The security and storage of your backup files outside of the app are your responsibility.

### 5. Data Deletion

In accordance with App Store guidelines, you have full control over your data. You can permanently delete your account and all associated data from within the app. This can be done via:
`Settings > Account & Profile > Clear Account`

This action is **irreversible** and will perform a comprehensive removal of:
- All financial records from your device.
- Your authentication credentials from the device's Keychain.
- All app-related settings and preferences.

### 6. Children's Privacy

BudgetOrbit is not intended for use by children under the age of 4 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
